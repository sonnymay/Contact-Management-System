# Contact Management System

Hello! This is a simple contact management system developed in Python. This is a command-line application where you can add, display, and delete contacts.

## Features

1. **Add a contact:** You can add a contact by entering their name, email, and phone number.
2. **Display contacts:** You can display all the contacts that have been added.
3. **Delete a contact:** You can delete a contact by entering their name.

## Usage

To run the application, simply navigate to the directory containing the script and use the following command:

```bash
python contact_management.py
```
Then, follow the prompts in the command line to add, display, or delete contacts.

## Limitations

Please be aware that this is a very basic implementation and there is no persistent database. Any contacts you add will be lost once you close the application. This project is intended as a learning tool and is not suited for real-world contact management needs.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please feel free to report any issues or suggest new features.
